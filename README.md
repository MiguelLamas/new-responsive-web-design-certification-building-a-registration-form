# new-responsive-web-design-certification-building-a-registration-form

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

You can use HTML forms to collect information from people who visit your webpage.

In this course, I revisited HTML forms by building a signup page. I practiced how to control what types of data people can type into my form, and learnt some new CSS tools for styling my page.
